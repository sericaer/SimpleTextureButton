# SimpleTextureButton
A Godot control for simple texture button.
##
I wrote this because the usage of texture button is cumbersome, the normal texture, pressed texture, hover texture, disable texture and bitmap texture is needed.

SimpleTextureButton only need normal texture. the bitmap is auto generated from normal texture. And not need pressed texture, hover texture, disable texture, these effect is implement by modulate color.
